 abstract = {This paper considers the modeling of road congestion subject to peak-load demand. The standard model contains ambiguities and is poorly specified. These problems can be eliminated by working with a structural model that explicitly treats the congestion technology and drivers' behavioral decisions. The paper provides a detailed analysis of a particular structural model--William Vickrey's model of bottleneck congestion in the morning rush-hour auto commute, extended to treat elastic (i.e., price-sensitive) demand--and examines some economic implications of the structural approach.},

    abstract = { Several researchers have analyzed queueing patterns at bottleneck sites on freeways during the morning peak. However, all previous studies have assumed that each commuter passes only one bottleneck during his commuting trip. Here, we consider the possibility that some commuters pass two bottlenecks on their way to work. The objective is to obtain cumulative arrival curves at each of the two bottlenecks, given who passes both bottlenecks and who passes only one, and their desired arrival times at their work places (work starting times). Each commuter using the freeway is assumed to have the same travel cost function which consists of time-dependent costs due to queueing delay (waiting time in a queue) and schedule delay (the time difference between his actual and desired arrival time at the work place). Commuter trips are assigned temporally so as to establish an equilibrium in which each commuter seeks to minimize his travel cost. The queue evolutions illustrate a service priority at the downstream bottleneck in favor of commuters passing only the downstream bottleneck. One of the countermeasures for this equity problem in the service priority would be to meter the favored commuters. }

    abstract = { D. Braess and others have shown that creating a new link in a congested network, or adding capacity to an existing link, can raise total travel costs if drivers switch routes. Here we show that a paradox can also result when routes are fixed, but users choose when to travel. As is true of the Braess paradox, the paradox here arises when the inefficiency due to underpricing of congestion increases by more than the direct benefit of the new capacity. For a corridor with two groups of drivers, we show that expanding capacity of an upstream bottleneck raises travel costs when the reduction in congestion upstream is more than offset by increased congestion downstream. Metering can thus improve efficiency. Optimal capacity for an upstream bottleneck is equal to, or smaller than, optimal capacity downstream. Total construction costs equal total variable travel costs when capacities are optimal and construction costs are independent of scale. }

The basis of our approach is the transformation of the formulation of equilibrium conditions in a conventional “Eulerian coordinate system” into one in a “Lagrangian-like coordinate system.” This enables us to evaluate dynamic travel times easily, and to achieve a deep understanding of the mathematical structure of the problem, in particular, about the properties of the demand and supply (queuing) sub-models, relations with dynamic system optimal assignment, and differences between the morning and evening rush problems. Building on these foundations, we establish rigorous results on the existence and uniqueness of equilibria.}

However, despite their theoretical foundations, there is a lack of comparative analysis between simula- tor results and theoretical models in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing METROPOLIS2, a novel mesoscopic transport simulator capable of simulating agents’ travel decisions (including mode, departure-time, and route choice), based on discrete-choice theory within a dynamic, continuous-time framework. We demonstrate METROPOLIS2’s functionality through its application to the single-road bottleneck model and validate its ability to replicate analytical results. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of METROPOLIS2 in large-scale scenarios. Fi- nally, we compare METROPOLIS2’s results with those of the original METROPOLIS1 simulator in a simulation of Paris, highlighting its speed and ability to converge to an equilibrium.},

    abstract = { This paper aims to study the effects of travel information provision on risk-averse travelers when travel time is uncertain. A stochastic bottleneck model is examined with risk-averse commuters, in which the free-flow travel time is assumed to be uncertain and follows a uniform distribution. A mean-variance approach is adopted to measure the travel cost under risk. It is proven that the individual travel cost at bottleneck equilibrium monotonically increases with the risk-aversion level. With a higher risk-aversion level, the morning peak hour starts earlier, but the duration of the peak hour remains constant regardless of the risk-aversion level. If improvement in information quality can reduce the travel time uncertainty, risk-averse commuters will benefit from the higher quality of information. Nevertheless, when the cost of information provision is also considered, the optimal information provision strategy is derived to minimize the total system cost. The numerical examples demonstrate the information efficiency and provision strategy. The findings reveal the congestion patterns of a stochastic bottleneck with risk-averse travelers and will guide us to provide appropriate travel information. }

However, existing models typically assume that no travelers are inframarginal regarding when to travel; that is, given equilibrium travel times, no travelers strictly prefer their ex ante departure time to all others. In this article, I address this shortcoming by incorporating inframarginal travelers into these models. This change significantly improves these models' ability to fit the data and changes policy prescriptions. In the case of congestion pricing, it typically changes the optimal toll by at least 25\% and significantly worsens the distributional impacts.},

    abstract = { Dynamic user equilibrium has received considerable theoretical attention for morning peak-period travel but very little for the evening peak. In an attempt to redress this imbalance, morning and evening travel are characterized and compared by using Vickrey’s bottleneck model. To focus ideas, it is assumed that morning and evening travel differ in just one respect: scheduling preferences for the morning are defined in terms of arrival time at work, whereas preferences for the evening are defined in terms of departure time from work. Sufficient conditions are identified for the existence and uniqueness of a deterministic dynamic user equilibrium in terms of departure times for the morning and evening peaks. These conditions, which go well beyond previous work, involve relatively general assumptions about the schedule delay cost functions for morning and evening and essentially no restrictions on the degree of heterogeneity in trip-timing preferences of travelers. Plausibility of the conditions is examined in light of the limited empirical evidence. A numerical example is developed at length to illustrate the importance of traveler heterogeneity and the extent of differences between morning and evening in the time pattern of departures and aggregate travel costs. }

abstract = {Travel time is widely recognized as an important performance measure for assessing highway operating conditions. There are two methods for obtaining travel time: direct measurement, or estimation. For the latter, previously developed models tend to underestimate travel times under congested conditions because of the difficulties of calculations of vehicle queue formations and dissipations. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can estimate travel time on a freeway using Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) where the states correspond to whether or not the link is congested. The expected travel time for a given route can be obtained for time periods during which the demand is relatively constant. Estimates from the model are compared to field-measured travel time. Statistical analyses suggest that the estimated travel times do not differ from the measured travel time at the 99\% confidence level.}
