 abstract = {This paper considers the modeling of road congestion subject to peak-load demand. The standard model contains ambiguities and is poorly specified. These problems can be eliminated by working with a structural model that explicitly treats the congestion technology and drivers' behavioral decisions. The paper provides a detailed analysis of a particular structural model--William Vickrey's model of bottleneck congestion in the morning rush-hour auto commute, extended to treat elastic (i.e., price-sensitive) demand--and examines some economic implications of the structural approach.},

    abstract = { Several researchers have analyzed queueing patterns at bottleneck sites on freeways during the morning peak. However, all previous studies have assumed that each commuter passes only one bottleneck during his commuting trip. Here, we consider the possibility that some commuters pass two bottlenecks on their way to work. The objective is to obtain cumulative arrival curves at each of the two bottlenecks, given who passes both bottlenecks and who passes only one, and their desired arrival times at their work places (work starting times). Each commuter using the freeway is assumed to have the same travel cost function which consists of time-dependent costs due to queueing delay (waiting time in a queue) and schedule delay (the time difference between his actual and desired arrival time at the work place). Commuter trips are assigned temporally so as to establish an equilibrium in which each commuter seeks to minimize his travel cost. The queue evolutions illustrate a service priority at the downstream bottleneck in favor of commuters passing only the downstream bottleneck. One of the countermeasures for this equity problem in the service priority would be to meter the favored commuters. }

    abstract = { D. Braess and others have shown that creating a new link in a congested network, or adding capacity to an existing link, can raise total travel costs if drivers switch routes. Here we show that a paradox can also result when routes are fixed, but users choose when to travel. As is true of the Braess paradox, the paradox here arises when the inefficiency due to underpricing of congestion increases by more than the direct benefit of the new capacity. For a corridor with two groups of drivers, we show that expanding capacity of an upstream bottleneck raises travel costs when the reduction in congestion upstream is more than offset by increased congestion downstream. Metering can thus improve efficiency. Optimal capacity for an upstream bottleneck is equal to, or smaller than, optimal capacity downstream. Total construction costs equal total variable travel costs when capacities are optimal and construction costs are independent of scale. }

abstract = {This paper presents a transparent approach to the analysis of dynamic user equilibrium and clarifies the properties of a departure-time choice equilibrium of a corridor problem where discrete multiple bottlenecks exist along a freeway. The basis of our approach is the transformation of the formulation of equilibrium conditions in a conventional “Eulerian coordinate system” into one in a “Lagrangian-like coordinate system.” This enables us to evaluate dynamic travel times easily, and to achieve a deep understanding of the mathematical structure of the problem, in particular, about the properties of the demand and supply (queuing) sub-models, relations with dynamic system optimal assignment, and differences between the morning and evening rush problems. Building on these foundations, we establish rigorous results on the existence and uniqueness of equilibria.}

abstract = {Transport simulators can be used to compute the equilibrium between transporta- tion demand and supply within complex transportation systems. However, despite their theoretical foundations, there is a lack of comparative analysis between simula- tor results and theoretical models in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing METROPOLIS2, a novel mesoscopic transport simulator capable of simulating agents’ travel decisions (including mode, departure-time, and route choice), based on discrete-choice theory within a dynamic, continuous-time framework. We demonstrate METROPOLIS2’s functionality through its application to the single-road bottleneck model and validate its ability to replicate analytical results. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of METROPOLIS2 in large-scale scenarios. Fi- nally, we compare METROPOLIS2’s results with those of the original METROPOLIS1 simulator in a simulation of Paris, highlighting its speed and ability to converge to an equilibrium.},

A bibliometric analysis approach is adopted for identifying the distribution of all journal publications, influential papers, top contributing authors, and leading topics in the past half century. The literature is classified according to recurring themes into travel behavior analysis, demand-side strategies, supply-side strategies, and joint strategies of demand and supply sides. For each theme, typical extended models developed to date are surveyed. Some potential directions for further studies are discussed.}

    abstract = { This paper aims to study the effects of travel information provision on risk-averse travelers when travel time is uncertain. A stochastic bottleneck model is examined with risk-averse commuters, in which the free-flow travel time is assumed to be uncertain and follows a uniform distribution. A mean-variance approach is adopted to measure the travel cost under risk. It is proven that the individual travel cost at bottleneck equilibrium monotonically increases with the risk-aversion level. With a higher risk-aversion level, the morning peak hour starts earlier, but the duration of the peak hour remains constant regardless of the risk-aversion level. If improvement in information quality can reduce the travel time uncertainty, risk-averse commuters will benefit from the higher quality of information. Nevertheless, when the cost of information provision is also considered, the optimal information provision strategy is derived to minimize the total system cost. The numerical examples demonstrate the information efficiency and provision strategy. The findings reveal the congestion patterns of a stochastic bottleneck with risk-averse travelers and will guide us to provide appropriate travel information. }
