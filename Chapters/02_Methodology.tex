\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}

This chapter will present the methodology used throughout the thesis.
It will thus be articulated in different parts:
the first step will be building the model,
and finding a suitable method for retrieving the parameters from data.
After this, the method must be tested on several different scenarios of increasing complexity.
These include an initial synthetic dataset built accordingly to the model,
data simulated with a generic traffic simulator and, eventually,
real data from the sources described above.

The first step is thus giving an overview of the methods that are suitable for inferring the parameters from the data,
and explaining what was the chosen method and the reasons that determined its choice.
